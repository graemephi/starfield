The guts of [tiny-dso](https://tiny-dso.glitch.me).

## Starfield

A note on the language choice. It's ion from Per Vognsen's [bitwise](https://github.com/pervognsen/bitwise). It's basically C99 with some of the annoying bits filed off. Despite being unfinished and having a few bugs, it was very nice to write code in. There are no libraries for ion (asides from SDL and libc), but the point of this project was to not use any libraries.
